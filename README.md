# Sentiment-analysis
we will develop a Twitter Sentiment Analysis Web App in R using Shiny. In our project, we will focus on using Twitter, the most popular microblogging platform, for the task of sentiment analysis. We will show how to automatically collect a data for sentiment analysis and opinion mining purposes. We will perform linguistic analysis of the collected corpus and explain discovered phenomena. Using the corpus, we build a sentiment classifier, that is able to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments for a document. It is important for popular users such as celebrities, politicians, or corporations to understand their audiences, and to measure their influence toward audiences on Twitter. The goal of this study is to develop a measure of positive-negative influence for popular users on Twitter and reveal how this measure of influence is related to real-world phenomena. We will collect the tweets of certain popular users, together with the tweets of other users that will contain the @username of the popular users. Then, we will perform an empirical analysis of user sentiment on Twitter based on an analysis of negative and positive words. We will develop a measure of the positive-negative influence between popular users and their audience and then investigated whether the positive-negative influence changes over time.
